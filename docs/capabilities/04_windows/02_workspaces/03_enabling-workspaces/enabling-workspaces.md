## Enabling Workspaces

Enabling Workspaces means providing a [Workspaces App](../workspaces-app/index.html) for your project, including the [Workspaces API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/workspaces-api) library in your [Main app](../../../../developers/core-concepts/web-platform/overview/index.html) and [Web Client](../../../../developers/core-concepts/web-client/overview/index.html) applications and configuring the [Web Platform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/web-platform) library in your Main application to support Workspaces.

## Main Application

The [Main app](../../../../developers/core-concepts/web-platform/overview/index.html) is the place where you must specify the location of your Workspaces App and other settings for it ([Workspace hibernation](#main_application-hibernation), [application loading strategies](#main_application-loading_strategies), whether to [use the Main App as a Workspaces App](#main_application-using_the_main_app_as_a_workspaces_app)). Use the `workspaces` property of the configuration object when initializing the Glue42 [Web Platform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/web-platform) library to do so:

```javascript
const config = {
    workspaces: {
        src: "https://my-workspaces-app.com"
    }
};
```

This points the Glue42 Web Platform where to look for the Workspaces App which handles all Workspaces logic. The `workspaces` key has the following properties of which only the `src` property is required:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `src` | `string` | The location of the Workspaces App. |
| `hibernation` | `object` | Object with settings for [Workspace hibernation](#main_application-hibernation). Specify allowed number of active Workspaces and/or after what period of time to hibernate idle Workspaces. |
| `loadingStrategy` | `object` | Object with settings for [application loading strategies](#main_application-loading_strategies). Specify whether to load all applications at once, in batches at certain intervals or when the user activates them. |
| `isFrame` | `boolean` | Set to `true` if you are [using your Main app as a Workspaces App](#main_application-using_the_main_app_as_a_workspaces_app) as well. |
| `frameCache` | `boolean` | This property is meant to be used only if you are [using your Main app as a Workspaces App](#main_application-using_the_main_app_as_a_workspaces_app). If `true`, will preserve the state of the Workspaces App on refresh. On restart, however, the app will be loaded in its initial state. |

The [Web Platform](../../../../developers/core-concepts/web-platform/overview/index.html) app is also a [Web Client](../../../../developers/core-concepts/web-client/overview/index.html), so you must provide the [Workspaces API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/workspaces-api) library too:

```javascript
const config = {
    workspaces: {
        src: "https://my-workspaces-app.com"
    },
    glue: {
        libraries: [GlueWorkspaces]
    }
};
```

Finally, you must configure the `layouts` property to ensure that the Workspace Layouts will function properly:

```javascript
// Provide the location of your Workspaces App,
// the Workspaces API library and configure the Layouts library.
const config = {
    workspaces: {
        src: "https://my-workspaces-app.com"
    },
    glue: {
        libraries: [GlueWorkspaces]
    },
    layouts: {
        mode: "session",
        // Layout definition objects of type `"Workspace"`.
        local: [ {...}, {...}]
    }
};

// By default, the `GlueWebPlatform()` and `GlueWorkspaces()`
// factory functions are attached to the global `window` object.
const { glue } = await GlueWebPlatform(config);
```

The `mode` property accepts two values - `"session"` or `"idb"`. Use the `"idb"` setting if you want the Workspace Layouts to be persisted using the `IndexedDB` API of the browser. This option is useful for testing and PoC purposes, because it simulates persisting and manipulating Workspace Layouts on a server. The `"session"` setting means that the Workspace Layouts will be handled using the browser session storage. Once the browser session is over (e.g., the user closes the Main app window), all user-created Layouts will be lost. If the Main app is only refreshed, however, the Workspace Layouts will still be available.

The `local` property expects an array of `Layout` objects of type `"Workspace"`. On startup, these predefined Layouts will be imported and merged with the already existing Workspace Layouts and the Layouts with the same names will be replaced. This ensures that the user-created Layouts will not be removed when in `"idb"` mode.

The following example demonstrates a simple `Layout` object defining a Workspace Layout:

```javascript
const layout = {
    name: "My Workspace",
    type: "Workspace",
    components: [
        {
            type: "Workspace",
            state: {
                children: [{
                    type: "column",
                    children: [
                        {
                            type: "group",
                            children: [
                                {
                                    type: "window",
                                    appName: "clientlist"
                                }
                            ]
                        },
                        {
                            type: "group",
                            children: [
                                {
                                    type: "window",
                                    appName: "clientportfolio"
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }],
                config: {},
                context: {}
            }
        }
    ]
};
```

### Hibernation

Workspaces can be configured to use hibernation in order to free up system resources. Apps in hibernated Workspaces are closed and when the user activates the Workspace, they are loaded again in the same configuration. This allows for a more flexible system resource usage, as a single Workspace may contain many apps and the user may be working simultaneously with several Workspaces, not taking into account other applications that may already be heavily consuming system resources.

By default, hibernation is disabled. To enable and configure hibernating Workspaces, use the `hibernation` property of the `workspaces` key in the configuration object for the [Web Platform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/web-platform) library. The following example demonstrates how to allow only three active Workspaces at a time and how to hibernate all Workspaces that have been inactive for 1 minute:

```javascript
const config = {
    workspaces: {
        src: "https://my-workspaces-app.com",
        hibernation: {
            maximumActiveWorkspaces: {
                threshold: 3
            },
            idleWorkspaces: {
                idleMSThreshold: 60000
            }
        }
    },
    glue: {...},
    layouts: {...}
};

const { glue } = await GlueWebPlatform(config);
```

The `hibernation` key has the following properties, all of which are optional:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `maximumActiveWorkspaces` | `object` | Accepts an object with a `threshold` property which you can set to the number of allowed active Workspaces - e.g., if set to `3`, the last 3 used Workspaces will be active and all others will be hibernated. |
| `idleWorkspaces` | `object` | Accepts an object with an `idleMSThreshold` property which you can set to the number of milliseconds a Workspace can be idle before being hibernated. |

*For programmatic control of Workspace hibernation, see [Hibernation](../workspaces-api/index.html#workspace-hibernation) in the Workspaces API section.*

### Loading Strategies

Apps in Workspaces can be loaded using different strategies depending on whether everything should be loaded simultaneously from the very beginning, or the visible apps should be loaded first. If the visible apps are loaded first, you can specify whether the invisible ones (hidden behind another app as a tab) should load only when the user activates them, or should start loading in the background at set intervals.

The available loading strategies are `"direct"`, `"delayed"` and `"lazy"`. In `"direct"` mode, all apps are loaded on startup. In `"delayed"` mode, the visible apps are loaded first and then the invisible apps are loaded in batches at set intervals until all apps are eventually loaded. In `"lazy"` mode, the visible apps are loaded first and then invisible apps are loaded only on demand when the user activates them. This way some apps may never load if the user doesn't need them. Each strategy for loading apps in a Workspace has different advantages and disadvantages. It is important to take into consideration the actual user needs, as well as the available machine resources, before deciding on a specific strategy.

Advantages and disadvantages of the different loading strategies:

| Mode | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------|------------|---------------|
| `"direct"` | The user gets everything up and running from the very beginning. | The CPU usage will spike when opening the Workspaces (because all apps start loading at the same time). May lead to poor user experience. High memory consumption - all applications are loaded and take up memory, even if they remain unused. |
| `"delayed"` | The loading time of visible apps is decreased due to reduced CPU load at startup (invisible app aren't loaded initially). | High memory consumption - delayed loading, but still all apps are loaded and take up memory, even if they remain unused. |
| `"lazy"` | The loading time of visible apps is decreased due to reduced CPU load on startup (invisible app aren't loaded initially). Some apps might not be loaded at all if the user doesn't need them. Eventually, this leads to reduced memory usage. | Apps which aren't loaded initially are loaded only when the user activates them. This may be inconvenient if loading the application takes too long. |

To configure the default loading strategy globally, use the `loadingStrategy` property of the `workspaces` key in the configuration object for the [Web Platform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/web-platform) library. The following example demonstrates how to use `"delayed"` as a default strategy. The invisible apps will start loading in batches of 2 after an initial interval of 2 seconds and then every 3 seconds a new batch will start loading until all apps in the Workspace have been loaded:

```javascript
const config = {
    workspaces: {
        src: "https://my-workspaces-app.com",
        loadingStrategy: {
            defaultStrategy: "delayed",
            delayed: {
                initialOffsetInterval: 2000,
                interval: 3000,
                batch: 2
            }
        }
    },
    glue: {...},
    layouts: {...}
};

const { glue } = await GlueWebPlatform(config);
```

The `loadingStrategy` key has the following properties, all of which are optional:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `defaultStrategy` | `string` | Determines the default loading strategy. Can be `"direct"`, `"delayed"` or `"lazy"`. |
| `delayed` | `object` | Object with settings for the `"delayed"` strategy. |
| `showDelayedIndicator` | `boolean` | Whether to show a `Zzz` indicator on the tabs of the apps that haven't been loaded yet. Useful in development for testing purposes, but shouldn't be delivered to end users. |

The `delayed` object has the following properties, all of which are optional:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `initialOffsetInterval` | `number` | Initial period in milliseconds after which to start loading applications in batches. Defaults to `1000`. |
| `interval` | `number` | Interval in milliseconds at which to load the application batches. Defaults to `5000`. |
| `batch` | `number` | Number of applications in a batch to be loaded at each interval. Defaults to 1. |

*For programmatic control of Workspace loading strategies, see [Loading Strategies](../workspaces-api/index.html#workspace-loading_strategies) in the Workspaces API section.*

### Using the Main App as a Workspaces App

If you want to use your [Workspaces App](../workspaces-app/index.html) as a [Main app](../../../../developers/core-concepts/web-platform/overview/index.html) as well, you must set the `isFrame` property of the `workspaces` object to `true` when configuring the [Web Platform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/web-platform) library:

```javascript
const config = {
    workspaces: {
        src: "https://my-workspaces-app.com",
        isFrame: true,
        frameCache: true
    },
    glue: {...},
    layouts: {...}
};

const { glue } = await GlueWebPlatform(config);
```

Use the `frameCache` property to set the refresh behavior of the Main App when using it as a Workspaces App. If `true`, when the user refreshes the Main app, its current state will be preserved. If `false`, the Main app will be refreshed to its default state - e.g., an empty Workspace or a custom landing page for loading and creating Workspaces, depending on your specific implementation. The `frameCache` property doesn't affect restarting the Main app - if the user restarts the Main app, it will always load in its default state.

*Note that the `frameCache` property can be used only when the `isFrame` property is set to `true`.*

### Allowing Apps in the "Add Application" Menu 

To control whether an app will be available in the Workspace "Add Application" menu (the dropdown that appears when you click the "+" button to add an application), use the `includeInWorkspaces` property of the `customProperties` top-level key in your [application definition](../../../application-management/index.html#application_definitions):

```javascript
const config = {
    applications: {
        local: [
            {
                name: "my-app",
                title: "My App",
                type: "window",
                details: {
                    url: "https://my-domain.com/my-app"
                },
                customProperties: {
                    includeInWorkspaces: true
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    workspaces: {...},
    glue: {...},
    layouts: {...}
};

const { glue } = await GlueWebPlatform(config);
```

By default, the `includeInWorkspaces` property is set to `false`.

*For more details on application definitions, see the [Application Management](../../../application-management/index.html#application_definitions) section.*

## Web Client Applications

To enable the [Workspaces API](../../../../reference/core/latest/workspaces/index.html) in your [Web Client](../../../../developers/core-concepts/web-client/overview/index.html) applications, install the [`@glue42/web`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/web) and [`@glue42/workspaces-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/workspaces-api) packages and initialize the [Glue42 Web](../../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library by passing the `GlueWorkspaces()` factory function in the configuration object. When `GlueWeb()` resolves, the Workspaces API will be accessible through the `workspaces` property of the returned object - e.g., `glue.workspaces`. See below examples of how to enable the Workspaces API in JavaScript, React and Angular applications.

### JavaScript

Install the necessary packages:

```cmd
npm install --save @glue42/web @glue42/workspaces-api
```

Initialize the Glue42 Web library enabling the Workspaces API:

```javascript
const config = {
    libraries: [GlueWorkspaces]
};
const glue = await GlueWeb(config);

// Now you can access the Workspaces API through `glue.workspaces`.
```

By default, the `GlueWeb()` and `GlueWorkspaces()` factory functions are attached to the global `window` object.

### React

Install the necessary packages:

```cmd
npm install --save @glue42/react-hooks @glue42/workspaces-api
```

Initialize Glue42 either by: 

- using the `<GlueProvider />` component:

```javascript
import GlueWeb from "@glue42/web";
import GlueWorkspaces from "@glue42/workspaces-api";
import { GlueProvider } from "@glue42/react-hooks";

const settings = {
    web: {
        factory: GlueWeb,
        config: {
            libraries: [GlueWorkspaces]
        }
    }
};

ReactDOM.render(
    <GlueProvider fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>} settings={settings}>
        <App />
    </GlueProvider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

-  or using the `useGlueInit()` hook:

```javascript
import GlueWeb from "@glue42/web";
import GlueWorkspaces from "@glue42/workspaces-api";
import { useGlueInit } from "@glue42/react-hooks";

const App = () => {
    const settings = {
        web: {
            factory: GlueWeb,
            config: {
                libraries: [GlueWorkspaces]
            }
        }
    };
    const glue = useGlueInit(settings);

    return glue ? <Main glue={glue} /> : <Loader />;
};

export default App;
```

### Angular

Install the necessary packages:

```cmd
npm install --save @glue42/ng @glue42/workspaces-api
```

Pass the `GlueWorkspaces()` factory function to `GlueWeb()` using the `config` object:

```javascript
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";

import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
import { Glue42Ng } from "@glue42/ng";
import GlueWeb from "@glue42/web";
import GlueWorkspaces from "@glue42/workspaces-api";

@NgModule({
    declarations: [
        AppComponent
    ],
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        Glue42Ng.forRoot({ web: { factory: GlueWeb, config: { libraries: [GlueWorkspaces] } } })
    ],
    providers: [],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```
