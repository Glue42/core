*RAW*

Deploying a Core V2 project is heaps simpler than V1. Since the whole project basically consists of importing one of two possible packages in your app, all you need to do is just follow your standard deployment procedure.

One thing to note is that if you are using Workspaces, you need to also make sure that the workspace frame app that you can been using is also deployed in the expected location (set by initializing the web-platform package).

That's it - you can build your apps with whatever tool you like and deploy however you like.
