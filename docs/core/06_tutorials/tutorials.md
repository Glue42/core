You can find the tutorial [here](../../tutorials/vanilla-js/index.html).

## React

Apart from the main tools that comprise **Glue42 Core**, you can also use the [**Glue42 React Hooks**](../glue42-client/react/index.html) library which is based on React Hooks. This library makes using **Glue42 Core** in a React app easy and intuitive.
