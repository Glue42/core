## Overview

The [Glue42 Web](../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library provides you with the tools you need to further enhance your traditional web apps and PWAs. Achieving this does not require from your users to install any additional software. The Glue42 Web library offers sets of APIs that enable sharing data between applications and controlling the window behavior:
