## Overview

The Glue42 APIs and functionalities are available in all [Web Client](../../core-concepts/web-client/overview/index.html) apps, as well as in the [Main application](../../core-concepts/web-platform/overview/index.html), because its [Web Platform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/web-platform) library initializes internally the [Glue42 Web](../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library.

The [Glue42 Web](../../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library provides you with the tools you need to further enhance your traditional web apps and PWAs. Achieving this does not require from your users to install any additional software. The Glue42 Web library offers sets of APIs that enable sharing data between applications and controlling the window behavior:
