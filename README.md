Glue42 Core is a web application integration toolkit, aimed at unifying multiple apps into streamlined coherent workflows.

Glue42 Core works in all modern browsers, and focuses on Progressive Web Applications use cases.

## Features Overview

### Interop Services

Glue42 Core exposes a rich set of interoperability methods which allow web applications to seamlessly communicate and interact with each other. The message exchange happens on the client, through a shared web worker process.

### Window Management

Glue42 Core provides an abstraction layer on top of the standard browser window management APIs, which makes your app portable between Glue42 Core and Glue42 Enterprise. This layers allows you create, close and manipulate browser/PWA windows.

#### Layout Persistence

Glue42 Core support persistence of window layouts, so that your users can start their day right where they left it the previous one.

That is just the tip of the aisberg, check out the [Glue42 Core Capabilities](https://docs.glue42.com/core/what-is-glue42-core/capabilities/index.html) for detailed info.

### Glue42 Enterprise Compatibility

If you need advanced window management or connectivity to native applications, you can run your app in Glue42 Enterprise Desktop Client without any changes to the code.

### React Bindings

In addition to the standard JavaScript API, the interop methods are exposed through framework specific bindings for the most popular web frameworks, making the integration in your existing codebase a breeze. Currently we have [React bindings](https://docs.glue42.com/core/getting-started/setting-application/react/index.html) based on Hooks, with Angular on the way.
